Project Report: https://github.com/latifyahia/EmotionaAIChatbot/blob/master/LatifYahiaProjectEngReport.pdf

Lolly aims to cheer people up in real-time using facial recognition and machine learning. Lolly
does this by providing a platform that allows people to talk about their feelings to a bot. Lolly
also provides users with a personal profile that will enable them to view individual statistics
based on different emotions detected throughout various conversations with Lolly.

I planned to create a web application using Django, which is a web development framework.
Using Django, I was able to create a visually stunning and fully functional web application. I also
used different technologies such as RASA, a contextual open-source machine learning
framework for building my chatbot. Within my web application, I also used a JavaScript library
called face-api.js, a library used for facial recognition built using JavaScript and pre-trained
machine learning models. I also set up a JSON server using NodeJS to work as a fake restful API
to store emotions detected through Django and pass them across to RASA when required. I also
decided to use AWS as the hosting service for my web application.

Just as planned, I completed the project, and the result of the project surpassed my
expectations. Lolly is fully functional, using facial recognition to detect the user’s current
emotion through their webcam. Lolly will communicate to the user differently depending on
the users’ present emotion.

In conclusion, I am pleased with the result of the project. If I were to continue working on this
project, I would improve the NLU (natural-language understanding) model for the chatbot.
Improving the NLU (natural-language understanding) model would give more variety and
complexity to the chatbot and how it handles incoming messages by the user.
